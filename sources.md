## Considerations
* All of these services host content that's been created or shared by a user him or herself, and these are the most important to synchronize and store for the user. However, many also host content shared by others that relates to an Asheville user in some way, such as through tags, comments or likes. We'll likely want to provide options for users to choose which kinds of related content they want to store (e.g. all tweets they've favorited on Twitter, all the photos in which they've been tagged on Facebook, or all tips they've liked on Foursquare).
